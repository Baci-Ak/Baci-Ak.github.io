									<h2><a href="#">Fractal Derivatives in Data Science<br /></a></h2>
								</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/fractals_banner.png" alt="Fractals" /></a>
									<p>Fractals are complex structures that exhibit self-similarity and intricate patterns at every scale. They have applications across various fields, including data science, where they help in understanding non-linear patterns, complex systems, and dimensionality reduction. Let's dive into the fascinating world of fractals, starting from the basics and moving to advanced concepts and mathematical derivations.</p>
									<ul class="actions special">
										<li><a href="#" class="button" onclick="toggleDetails(event, 'fractals-details')">Read More</a></li>
									</ul>
									<div id="fractals-details" style="display: none;">
									<h3>Introduction</h3>
									<p>Fractal derivatives extend traditional calculus to model complex, non-linear phenomena often encountered in data science. By incorporating scaling properties of fractals, these derivatives offer new ways to analyze and interpret data.</p>
									
									<h3>Fractal Derivatives: Definitions and Concepts</h3>
									
									<h4>Step 1: Basic Concept of Velocity and Fractal Scaling</h4>
									<h5>Fig1: Velocity in Euclidean and Fractal Space</h5>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Velocity_Diagram.png" alt="Velocity in Euclidean and Fractal Space" /></a>
									
									<h4>Velocity in Euclidean Space</h4>
									<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
									<p>Velocity (\(v\)) in Euclidean space is defined as the rate of change of distance (\(dx\)) with respect to time (\(dt\)).</p>
									<p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
									<p>\[ v = \frac{dx}{dt} \]</p>
									<p>As shown in Fig1 above, the Euclidean velocity \(v\) is straightforward and linear, representing the slope of the distance-time graph at any given point.</p>
									
									<h4>Fractal Velocity in Fractal Spacetime</h4>
									<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
									<p>Fractal velocity (\(v'\)) in fractal spacetime is defined as the rate of change of distance (\(dx\)) scaled by a factor \(\beta\) with respect to time (\(dt\)) scaled by a factor \(\alpha\).</p>
									<p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
									<p>\[ v' = \frac{dx^\beta}{dt^\alpha} \]</p>
									<p>where:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>\(dx^\beta\) represents the change in position scaled by factor \(\beta\).</li>
										<li>\(dt^\alpha\) represents the change in time scaled by factor \(\alpha\).</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Referring again to Fig1, the fractal velocity \(v'\) adapts the linear concept to fractal geometry, where scaling factors \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) modify the dimensions to capture the complexity of the fractal space.</p>
									
									<h4>Step 2: Introducing Fractal Derivative</h4>
									<h5>Fig2: Fractal Derivative</h5>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Fractal_Derivative.png" alt="Fractal Derivative" /></a>
									
									<p><strong>Limit Definition of Fractal Derivative:</strong></p>
									
									<h4>Traditional Derivative</h4>
									<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
									<p>The derivative of a function \(f(t)\) with respect to \(t\) is defined as the rate at which the function value changes as the input \(t\) changes.</p>
									<p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
									<p>\[ \frac{df(t)}{dt} = \lim_{t_1 \to t} \frac{f(t_1) - f(t)}{t_1 - t} \]</p>
									<p>Fig2 shows the traditional derivative as the slope of the tangent line at any point on the function \(f(t)\). The marked points \(f(t)\) and \(f(t_1)\) illustrate the function values at \(t\) and \(t_1\), respectively, with the dashed lines indicating the approach of \(t\) to \(t_1\).</p>
									
									<h4>Fractal Derivative</h4>
									<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
									<p>The fractal derivative modifies the traditional derivative by incorporating a fractal scaling factor \(\alpha\), which adjusts the rate of change to account for fractal properties.</p>
									<p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
									<p>\[ \frac{\partial f(t)}{\partial t^\alpha} = \lim_{t_1 \to t} \frac{f(t_1) - f(t)}{t_1^\alpha - t^\alpha} \]</p>
									<p>where:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>\(\frac{\partial f(t)}{\partial t^\alpha}\) denotes the fractal derivative of \(f(t)\).</li>
										<li>\(t_1^\alpha\) and \(t^\alpha\) represent the scaled time points.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<p><strong>Derivation:</strong></p>
									<ol>
										<li>Start with the traditional derivative definition:
											<p>\[ \frac{df(t)}{dt} = \lim_{t_1 \to t} \frac{f(t_1) - f(t)}{t_1 - t} \]</p>
										</li>
										<li>Incorporate fractal scaling for time:
											<p>\[ t \to t^\alpha \]</p>
											<p>\[ t_1 \to t_1^\alpha \]</p>
										</li>
										<li>Apply the scaling to the derivative definition:
											<p>\[ \frac{\partial f(t)}{\partial t^\alpha} = \lim_{t_1 \to t} \frac{f(t_1) - f(t)}{t_1^\alpha - t^\alpha} \]</p>
										</li>
									</ol>
									<p>In Fig2, the fractal derivative is illustrated as adapting the traditional slope concept to account for fractal scaling, creating a more nuanced understanding of rate changes in fractal contexts. The points \(f(t)\) and \(f(t_1)\) and the dashed lines indicate the limits as \(t\) approaches \(t_1\), emphasizing how the fractal scaling factors \(\alpha\) modify the derivative.</p>
									
									<h4>Step 3: Generalized Fractal Derivative</h4>
									<h5>Fig3: Generalized Fractal Derivative</h5>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Generalized_Fractal_Derivative.png" alt="Generalized Fractal Derivative" /></a>
									
									<p><strong>General Definition:</strong></p>
									
									<h4>Traditional Higher-Order Derivative</h4>
									<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
									<p>The higher-order derivative of a function \(f(t)\) is the derivative of its derivative, representing the rate of change of the rate of change.</p>
									<p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
									<p>\[ \frac{d^2 f(t)}{dt^2} = \lim_{t_1 \to t} \frac{\frac{df(t_1)}{dt} - \frac{df(t)}{dt}}{t_1 - t} \]</p>
									<p>Fig3 illustrates the traditional second-order derivative as the curvature or concavity of the function \(f(t)\).</p>
									
									<h4>Generalized Fractal Derivative</h4>
									<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
									<p>The generalized fractal derivative extends the concept of fractal derivatives to higher orders by introducing another scaling factor \(\beta\), which adjusts the power to which the function is raised.</p>
									<p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
									<p>\[ \frac{\partial^\beta f(t)}{\partial t^\alpha} = \lim_{t_1 \to t} \frac{f^\beta(t_1) - f^\beta(t)}{t_1^\alpha - t^\alpha}, \quad \alpha > 0, \beta > 0 \]</p>
									<p>where:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>\(\frac{\partial^\beta f(t)}{\partial t^\alpha}\) denotes the generalized fractal derivative.</li>
										<li>\(f^\beta(t)\) represents the function \(f(t)\) raised to the power \(\beta\).</li>
									</ul>

									<p><strong>Derivation:</strong></p>
									<ol>
										<li>Start with the basic fractal derivative:
											<p>\[ \frac{\partial f(t)}{\partial t^\alpha} = \lim_{t_1 \to t} \frac{f(t_1) - f(t)}{t_1^\alpha - t^\alpha} \]</p>
										</li>
										<li>Extend to higher orders by raising \(f(t)\) to the power \(\beta\):
											<p>\[ \frac{\partial^\beta f(t)}{\partial t^\alpha} = \lim_{t_1 \to t} \frac{f^\beta(t_1) - f^\beta(t)}{t_1^\alpha - t^\alpha} \]</p>
										</li>
									</ol>
									<p>Fig3 showcases the generalized fractal derivative by depicting functions raised to different powers, emphasizing how scaling factors \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) provide a more detailed view of changes over time.</p>

									<p><strong>Definition for Fractal Sets:</strong></p>
									<p>For a function \(y(t)\) defined on a fractal set \(F^\alpha\), the fractal derivative at a point \(t\) within this set considers the fractal measure \(S_F^\alpha\), which represents the fractal geometry of the set.</p>
									
									<p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
									<p>\[ D_F^\alpha y(t) = \begin{cases}
									\underset{x \to t}{\lim} \frac{y(x) - y(t)}{S_F^\alpha(x) - S_F^\alpha(t)}, & \text{if } t \in F; \\
									0, & \text{otherwise}.
									\end{cases} \]</p>
									<p>where:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>\(D_F^\alpha\) denotes the fractal derivative on the fractal set \(F^\alpha\).</li>
										<li>\(S_F^\alpha\) represents the fractal measure.</li>
										<li>\(y(t)\) is the function defined on the fractal set.</li>
										<li>\(x\) and \(t\) are points in the fractal set.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<p><strong>Derivation:</strong></p>
									<ol>
										<li>Start with the generalized fractal derivative:
											<p>\[ \frac{\partial^\beta f(t)}{\partial t^\alpha} = \lim_{t_1 \to t} \frac{f^\beta(t_1) - f^\beta(t)}{t_1^\alpha - t^\alpha} \]</p>
										</li>
										<li>Apply the definition to fractal sets:
											<p>\[ D_F^\alpha y(t) = \lim_{x \to t} \frac{y(x) - y(t)}{S_F^\alpha(x) - S_F^\alpha(t)} \]</p>
										</li>
										<li>Introduce the condition for points within the fractal set:
											<p>\[ D_F^\alpha y(t) = \begin{cases}
												\underset{x \to t}{\lim} \frac{y(x) - y(t)}{S_F^\alpha(x) - S_F^\alpha(t)}, & \text{if } t \in F; \\
												0, & \text{otherwise}.
											\end{cases} \]</p>
										</li>
									</ol>
									<p>As illustrated in Fig4, fractal derivatives on fractal sets such as the Cantor set involve considering the fractal measure, \(S_F^\alpha\), and highlight the intricacies of fractal geometry in calculating rates of change.</p>
									
									<h3>Applications in Data Science and Machine Learning</h3>

									<h4>Application in Anomalous Diffusion</h4>
									<p>The fractal derivative models anomalous diffusion processes, described by:</p>
									<p>\[ \frac{du(x, t)}{dt^\alpha} = D \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\beta} \left( \frac{\partial u(x, t)}{\partial x^\beta} \right) \]</p>
									<p>Here, \(u(x, t)\) represents the concentration of diffusing particles, \(D\) is the diffusion coefficient, and \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are scaling factors for time and space, respectively.</p>
									<p>Using transformations \(t' = t^\alpha\) and \(x' = x^\beta\), the solution has a stretched Gaussian kernel:</p>
									<p>\[ u(x, t) = \frac{1}{2 \pi t^\alpha} e^{-\frac{x^{2\beta}}{4t^\alpha}} \]</p>
									<p>The mean squared displacement is:</p>
									<p>\[ \langle x^2(t) \rangle \propto t^{\frac{3\alpha - \alpha\beta}{2\beta}} \]</p>
									
									<h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
									<h4>Example Function: Fractal Derivative</h4>
									<p>Consider \( f(t) = t^2 \). The fractal derivative with \( \alpha = 0.5 \) is:</p>
									<p>\[ \frac{\partial f(t)}{\partial t^{0.5}} = \lim_{t_1 \to t} \frac{t_1^2 - t^2}{t_1^{0.5} - t^{0.5}} \]</p>
									<p>By performing the limit operation, we obtain the fractal derivative at a specific \( t \).</p>
									
									<h3>Conclusion</h3>
									<p>Fractal derivatives provide a powerful tool for capturing complex, multi-scale patterns in data. By applying these concepts in data 
										science and machine learning, we can improve predictions, detect anomalies, reduce dimensions, and extract meaningful features from 
										various types of data. The mathematical derivations and detailed case studies illustrate the practical applications and benefits of 
										fractal derivatives.</p>
